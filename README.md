Since these products are always out of stock due to COVID, this program will help purchase the product for you.

This bot requires you to download a webdriver for your preferred browswer to be accessed by Selenium. This is the most recent link for Chrome (version 84) https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=84.0.4147.30/

I recommend using chrome as it is the browser used in development and testing. Here is a link to other versions of the webdriver if you are not on Chrome verison 84. https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads 

This bot also requires that you add the selenium libraries to your python interpreter.
